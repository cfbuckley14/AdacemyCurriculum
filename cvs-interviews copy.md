## CVs 
- [Example](https://dev.io-academy.uk/resources/Resume.pdf)
- [Tool for making a CV](https://rxresu.me/)
- Treat your CV like a portfolio design
    - Not a boring legal document
    - Still a professional document
    - Should represent you
    - Consistent design/colors with your portfolio can be good

- Sections for your CV, in this order:
    - About you
    - Portfolio/Projects
    - Employment History
    - Education
    - Other (professional qualifications, volunteering)

- Contact details
    - Portfolio Link
    - Github link
    - Email address ([tip](https://danq.me/2017/09/26/gmail-plus/))
    - Get a burner phone!

- Write about yourself
    - Employers want to hear about your interests
        - Both personal and professional
    - Programming is a team sport, they are hiring a team member
    - Make sure your CV sounds like you
    - Companies want people who love what they do    
    - Companies hire *people*
    - Tell us about *you*, it should sound like you

- Do not list your skills/technologies
    - Use the projects section
    - Tech needs context, listing languages means nothing

- FE, BE or FS?
    - Write a fullstack CV unless your sure you want a specific role
    - Ensure your aspirations align with the role

- Anomalies
    - Explain any employment gaps
    - Be honest!
     
- Dont give yourself a label
    - You're not a "Junior" or a "Senior"
    - Dont rate yourself or your skills
    
- Do not open yourself to discrimination
    - No photos
    - No DOB
    - No specific addresses, city/town is enough

- When applying direct, always send a covering letter
    - Write one for each company, dont just send a generic letter
    - [How do I even cover letter?!](https://dev.io-academy.uk/resources/cover-letters.webp)

- Social media
    - You do **not** have to have it
    - LinkedIn is worth it (get an iO banner!)
    - Do a privacy check on your profiles

## Applying for tech jobs

- Join the #jobs channel in slack
- We have a #jobs-mid-senior channel for future
- #jobs-thinking for asking general career questions
- 3 main ways to find jobs:
    - Hiring Partners
    - Direct applications
    - Recruiters/jobsites

### Hiring Partners

- iO will introduce you to them
- iO will share contact/application details with you
    - If emailing direct, send a cover letter
- Will already know the curriculum and roughly your skills
- Will be hiring predominantly on company fit (both technical and personal)

### Direct applications

- Most tech companies are **always** hiring software developers
- Cold emailing companies is a very effective way of getting jobs
- Use meet-ups, awards, and tech support companies to find lists
- Most companies need developers these days
- Send a cover letter
    - The email **is** the cover letter, dont attach a seperate file
    - [How do I ever cover letter?!](https://dev.io-academy.uk/resources/cover-letters.webp)
- Attach your CV

### Recruiters/jobsites

- Jobs posted on job sites will mostly be from recruiters
- Most recruiters are awful, but necessary
- Remember recruiters work for the company, not you
- Keep a spreadsheet of jobs you apply for
- Don't let a recruiter put you forward for a role without finding out who the company is
- Recommended national job sites for dev roles:
    - [Totaljobs](https://www.totaljobs.com/)
    - [Reed](https://www.reed.co.uk/)
    - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
- Local job sites are good for SMEs
    - Google `{city} tech jobs` and look for links that dont have the location in the URL
- Don't bother sending cover letters to recruiters
- They will phone you and ask questions
- They might ask for a cover letter before putting you forward for a job
- Check pinned messages in #jobs for recommendations

## What to expect from the application process

- Every company is different
- Most common is a 3 stage process
    1. Initial interview - basic technical questions, usually with at least 1 dev
    2. Technical test
    3. Final interview - personality based, usually with lead dev/cto/director

### Technical tests
- 4 main types of technical tests
- We have exercises to practice all of these in module 9

#### Problem solving
- Online
- Completed in your own time
- Timeboxed
- Test your understanding of the fundamentals
- Sometimes algorithmic
- Either language agnostic or give you the choice
- Popular with big corporate companies as allows them to filter candidates quickly
- Practice on:
    - HackerRank
    - CodeWars
    - LeetCode
    - Cyber-dojo
- You will practice some of these on the course
- Some of the course exercises you've already done are based off of these

#### Project builds
- Most common
- Given a spec / set of requirements to build
- Often involve consuming an API
- Usually given a time limit, which is never enough
    - They will be interested in what order you tackle the problems given the time constraint
- Sometimes provided existing code (usually in a repo)
- Sometimes language/framework specific, sometimes agnostic
- Focus on code quality
- Practice these by building things:
    - Come up with your own projects
    - [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io)
    - [dev.to](https://dev.to/search?q=junior%20projects)
    - Open source work
    - Ask your trainers for project ideas

#### Whiteboard session
- Explain how you would build a solution to a problem
- Does not always require a whiteboard, can be verbal
- Least common
    - Especially these for remote assessments
- Take your time
- Assesses your abstract problem solving
- Practise by psuedo-coding projects
    - You don't have to build the project, just plan it
    - Architecture diagrams
    - Do it with a friend
- There may not be all information needed in the initial brief
    - Ask questions before starting, like during story estimates

#### Pair coding
- Given a small project/feature or bug to fix
- Screenshared with a developer
- They want to see how you approach problems
- What you do when you get stuck
- Code normally
    - Use Google
    - Psuedo code
- Common with SMEs
- Assess both technical and team working skills
- Practice by pair programming with people



## How to do tech interviews

**Remember that an interview is a two way process, you are interviewing them too**

- Be on time
    - Be early
    - Phone ahead if running late
    
- First impressions
    - Dress smart, unless otherwise instructed
        - Shirt/blouse/dress is fine
        - No need for a tie or jacket
    - Be polite and friendly
    
- Be prepared
    - Read the company website
    - Have questions about the company
    - Show you care about working for them
    - Have questions about the job role
    - Take some work to show
        - If possible take a device that you can show your work on
        
- Be consistent
    - Dont just say what you think they want to hear
    - Be honest

- There may be technical questions
    - Similar to the academy recap questions and tests
    - Don't be afraid to say you dont know
        - How would you find out?
        - Talk about what you do know

- Salary
    - Most first interviews will ask you your salary expectations
    - Say iO told you 25k (30 in London)
    - Dont accept less than 20
    - High salaries are not always good

- Ask for feedback
    > Is there anything that i have said today that you aren't comfortable with or feel like you would like more clarification on.
    
## Different kinds of company
- Agencies
    - Short deadlines
    - Focus on speed over quality
    - Seldom do unit tests or code reviews
    - Work with cutting edge tech
    - Build cool projects
    - Wide variety of work
- Software As A Service (SAAS)
    - Relaxed/no deadlines
    - Focus on code quality
    - Lots of unit tests, code reviews, pair programming
    - Often work on legacy systems/tech
    - Low variety of product (often on 1 product forever)
- Moving between them
