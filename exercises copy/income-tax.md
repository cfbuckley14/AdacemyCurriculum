For this tech test you will build a page that calculates the income tax of an annual salary based on UK income tax bands. 
[Use this page to get the current tax bands](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

- The page should have a single input box, for the users annual gross salary
- Upon submitting the salary, it should calculate the income tax applied to 
that salary and provide both an annual and monthly breakdown of the tax, gross and net pay
- It should display your tax free allowance, and the amount of salary that is eligible to be taxed
  - Note that there is no tax free allowance on income over £125,140
- It should show how much of your salary is being taxed at the different levels, as well as the total:
  - For example, a salary of £55,000: 
  - £12,570 is tax free
  - £42,430 is eligible, of that:
  - £37,700 is taxed at 20%: £7,540
  - £4,730 is taxed at 40%: £1,892
  - Total tax is: £9,432
