### Sprint Review prep
- Help team determine challenge review order
- And sprint review order

### Sprint Review
The main aim is to present a seamless, well organised presentation that doesn't waste time.

  - Project work
    - decide on who will be showcasing each completed story
    - prompt individuals to have what they are going to say planned out before sprint review
    - allow for 5-10mins of open questions at the end

BE PREPARED for all questions and demos - Scrum master is the facilitator of the meeting, not the spokesperson. 

### Sprint Retrospective
- The main aim is to encourage constructive feedback on the teams performance, not the individuals.
- This is a *safe space* to discuss what went right and what went wrong - remember its a blame free culture
- A good practice is to aim for 3 action points for next sprint
- Read the dynamic of the group, games available to stimulate discussion (have 2 in back pocket just in case)
  - Prepare Miro board with start / stop / keep sections (there are prebuilt sprint retro shapes in Miro)  
  - Or if you want to change it up, you can use one of these [retro games](http://www.funretrospectives.com/) (you still have to set up the board in Miro but those are some ideas on how to do it)

BE PREPARED TO STEP IN AND KEEP MEETING ON TRACK eg: timeboxing specfic discussions, encouraging quieter members to contribute
